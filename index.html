<p id="colorpink">Many cats dislike wearing any type of clothing, so the key is to go slowly 
    and not force a cat to wear a sweater if he really resists. ...
     If a cat does tolerate the sweater at all, he will probably need some time to get used to wearing it
</p>
<p class="colorpurple">Another great alternative to a cone for cats is baby clothes. Whether it's an adorable flannel 
    or just a onesie, these are great way
     to keep your cat protected while their injury heals. Most cats are a 3-6mo or 6-9mo size and these can work great when you need to cover their legs.

</p>
<p class="colorpurple" >Wearing clothes doesn't come naturally to pets and it can cause them stress, especially cats.
     Stressed cats might groom themselves a lot, be aggressive towards you or make more noise than usual.
      Dogs might show they're stressed by licking their lips, yawning or panting.
